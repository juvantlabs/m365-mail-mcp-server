/**
 * Tool categorization per handbook ADR 0004 (Agent action guardrails).
 *
 * - `read` — no mutations.
 * - `write_idempotent` — mutations where re-running with the same args
 *   reaches the same effective state (or is reversible by another
 *   tool of this server within the same session, e.g. create_draft
 *   reversible by delete_message).
 * - `write_irreversible` — external mutation that cannot be reverted by
 *   a subsequent automated call from this server (notifications sent
 *   to recipients, deletions without a deterministic restore path,
 *   payments). MUST gate via the two-phase confirmation token pattern
 *   (preview → token → execute) per ADR 0002. CI enforces this.
 * - `permission_mutating` — operations that create/modify standing
 *   access, sharing, or ownership of a resource (sharing-link creation,
 *   guest invite, permission grant/revoke, sensitivity-label change,
 *   ownership transfer, delegate/inbox-rule mutation that grants
 *   third-party access). Distinct from `write_irreversible` because
 *   the threat model is privilege escalation: a single call grants a
 *   third party persistent access that survives the session and
 *   bypasses content-level RW deny-lists. No tool in v0.1 carries
 *   this category — it is a pre-classification slot. CI Layer A
 *   (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) fails the build if any future tool
 *   touches a permission/sharing Graph endpoint without being
 *   classified here AND added to the workflow's allowlist.
 *
 * Ambiguous categorizations resolve to the strictest. When in doubt,
 * gate it.
