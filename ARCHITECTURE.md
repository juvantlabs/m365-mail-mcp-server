# Architecture — M365 Mail MCP Server

Design rationale for `@juvantlabs/m365-mail-mcp-server`. Read alongside the
[handbook MCP server spec](https://github.com/juvantlabs/handbook/blob/main/docs/repo-types/mcp-server.md)
for the cross-cutting conventions; this doc covers what's specific to
this server.

## Purpose

Microsoft 365 Outlook Mail via delegated Microsoft Graph: read messages, folders and attachments, and author/manage drafts (send is a later gated phase).

## Scope

(Fill in: which vendor APIs are wrapped, which are explicitly out of scope.)

### In scope

- _(list tools shipped here as they land)_

### Out of scope

- Vendor write operations — performed by the user in the vendor UI; not
  shipped as MCP tools.
- _(other intentional exclusions, with rationale)_

## Authentication

(Fill in: how the server authenticates to the vendor API. Document scope
qualifier from `agent_tool_matrix`. Note token storage location — never
in `.juvant/config.json`, never logged. Reference `@napi-rs/keyring` if
applicable.)

## Threat model

(Fill in: what attacker capabilities does this server defend against?
Reference the
[handbook security disclosure process](https://github.com/juvantlabs/handbook/blob/main/docs/security/disclosure-process.md)
and the 12-item anti-pattern checklist from the
[2026-05-03 ftaricano audit](https://gist.github.com/juvantlabs/a9fe0a76a23b0c1260b1e0ad3194a6da)
that informs this repo's security posture.)

### Universal Boundaries (per `SYSTEM_INVARIANTS.md` §4)

- No general-purpose URL forwarder primitive.
- No write tools beyond what's explicitly authorized.
- Per-tenant subprocess (no shared cache state across tenants).
- Stdout discipline: `console.error` only outside protocol path.

## Performance characteristics

(Fill in: typical request latency, max-file-size guard if applicable,
streaming download / upload paths if applicable.)

## Tool catalog

| Tool | Underlying API call | Input shape | Output shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(stub)_ | | | | |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | `^1.25.2` | MCP framing; ≥1.25.2 required (ReDoS + DNS rebinding fixes) |
| _(vendor SDK or HTTP client)_ | | |
