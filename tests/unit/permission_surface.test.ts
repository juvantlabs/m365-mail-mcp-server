/**
 * decisions#210 Layer B — synthetic permission-surface canary.
 *
 * Static invariant over `ALL_TOOLS` (single source of truth from
 * `src/tools/index.ts`). For every exposed tool, exactly one of the
 * following must hold:
 *
 *   1. Scopable — the tool's `inputSchema.properties` declares at
 *      least one parameter the upstream harness pre-tool-use hook
 *      can use to scope a per-agent / per-target deny-list against
 *      (message_id, folder_id, attachment_id, destination_folder_id).
 *
 *   2. NO_TARGET_TOOLS — the tool is on an explicit allowlist of
 *      target-less operations (mailbox-wide enumeration / new-resource
 *      creation). The harness cannot scope these by target shape and
 *      must apply a post-call result filter or block the tool outright
 *      per policy. Adding a new entry to NO_TARGET_TOOLS is a
 *      deliberate, reviewable security event.
 *
 *   3. permission_mutating — the tool is classified as
 *      privilege-escalation-class and is gated by CI Layer A in
 *      `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. v0.1 baseline: zero such tools.
 *
 * A tool that fits NONE of the three buckets is structurally
 * invisible to the harness deny-list hook — that is the failure mode
 * a future v0.2+ contribution might silently introduce. This test
 * fails the build before such a tool can merge.
 *
 * Runs unconditionally (no tenant calls, no secrets) so PRs from
 * contributors without VENDOR_SANDBOX_TOKEN still get the gate.
